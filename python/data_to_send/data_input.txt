Dogecoin was created by IBM software engineer Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and Adobe software engineer Jackson Palmer,
 who set out to create a peer-to-peer digital currency that could reach a broader demographic than Bitcoin. In addition, 
they wanted to distance it from the controversial history of other coins.[8] Dogecoin was offically launched on December 6, 
2013, and within the first 30 days there were over a million visitors to Dogecoin.com.[9]Palmer, at the time a member of the 
Adobe Systems marketing department in Sydney is credited with making the idea a reality.[10] Palmer had purchased the domain 
Dogecoin.com and added a splash screen, which featured the coin's logo and scattered Comic Sans text. Markus reached out to
 Palmer after seeing the site, and started efforts to develop the currency. Markus had designed Dogecoin's protocol based on 
existing cryptocurrencies Luckycoin and Litecoin,[11] which use scrypt technology in their proof-of-work algorithm.[12] 
The use of scrypt means that miners cannot use SHA-256 bitcoin mining equipment, and instead must use dedicated FPGA and 
ASIC devices for mining which are known to be more complex to produce.[13][14]On December 19, 2013, Dogecoin jumped nearly
 300 percent in value in 72 hours, rising from US$0.00026 to $0.00095,[15] with a volume of billions of Dogecoins per day. 
This growth occurred during a time when bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies were reeling from China's decision to forbid 
Chinese banks from investing into the bitcoin economy.[11] Three days later, Dogecoin experienced its first major crash by 
dropping by 80% due to this event and to large mining pools exploiting the small amount of computing power required at the
 time to mine Dogecoin.[16]
